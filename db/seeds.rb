sun = Star.create(name_en: "sun", name_fr: "soleil", image_path: "venus.png", classification: "yellow dwarf", summary: "The Sun is a big, hot star in space that shines brightly in our sky during the day. It's like a giant ball of fire, but it's not really on fire like a campfire. Instead, it's made up of super-hot gas called plasma. The Sun is so big that it's much larger than any planet, including Earth!", funfact: "Ever noticed the Sun's got some funky pockmarks on its face? Yep, those are sunspots! They're like the Sun's version of zits, but don't worry, they're still super hot! And hey, the Sun's got some wild moves too - it throws these epic tantrums called solar flares and solar storms. But no need to panic, Earth's got its cosmic sunscreen, aka the atmosphere, keeping us safe from the Sun's shenanigans!")

# Planets
mercury = Planet.create(name_en: "mercury", name_fr: "mercure", image_path: "mercury.png", star_id: sun.id, classification: "rocky", summary: "Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun and is named after the speedy messenger of the Roman gods. It's a small, rocky world with a surface that's covered in craters, similar to our Moon. Its extreme temperatures swing between scorching hot during the day and freezing cold at night.", funfact: "Despite being the closest planet to the Sun, Mercury isn't the hottest - that title goes to Venus!" )
Card.create(object: mercury)

venus = Planet.create(name_en: "venus", name_fr: "v√©nus", star_id: sun.id, image_path: "venus.png", classification: "rocky", summary: "Venus is often called Earth's 'sister planet' because of its similar size and composition. It's the hottest planet in our solar system due to its thick atmosphere that traps heat, making it a fiery inferno. Venus' surface is shrouded in thick clouds of sulfuric acid, hiding its rocky terrain beneath.", funfact: "Venus spins in the opposite direction compared to most other planets, so if you were standing on its surface, you'd see the Sun rise in the west and set in the east - talk about a mind-bender!")
Card.create(object: venus)

earth = Planet.create(name_en: "earth", name_fr: "terre", star_id: sun.id, image_path: "earth.png", classification: "rocky", summary: "Earth is our home sweet home, the only known planet to support life. It's covered in vast oceans, towering mountains, and lush forests. Our planet has a protective atmosphere that keeps us safe and cozy. Earth is the perfect place for us to live, with just the right temperature and conditions for life to thrive.", funfact: "Earth is the only planet not named after a god or goddess.")
Card.create(object: earth)

mars = Planet.create(name_en: "mars", name_fr: "mars", star_id: sun.id, image_path: "mars.png", classification: "rocky", summary: "Mars is often called the 'Red Planet' because of its rusty red surface. It's home to the tallest volcano in the solar system, Olympus Mons, and the deepest canyon, Valles Marineris. Scientists think Mars might have had oceans in the past, making it a potential place to search for signs of ancient life.", funfact: "Mars has two tiny moons, Phobos and Deimos, named after the sons of Ares, the Greek god of war - fitting names for moons of the Red Planet!")
Card.create(object: mars)

jupiter = Planet.create(name_en: "jupiter", name_fr: "jupiter", star_id: sun.id, image_path: "jupiter.png", classification: "gas giant", summary: "Jupiter is the largest planet in our solar system, a colossal ball of gas with swirling clouds and a famous Great Red Spot, a massive storm that's been raging for centuries. Jupiter has a strong magnetic field, making it a protective shield for the inner planets from cosmic debris.", funfact: "Jupiter's Great Red Spot is so huge that you could fit Earth inside it - not that you'd want to be in the middle of a gigantic storm!")
Card.create(object: jupiter)

saturn = Planet.create(name_en:"saturn", name_fr: "saturne", star_id: sun.id, image_path: "saturn.png", classification: "gas giant", summary: "Saturn is known for its magnificent rings, made up of icy particles ranging in size from tiny grains to large chunks. Beneath its stunning rings, Saturn is a gas giant with a rocky core surrounded by layers of hydrogen and helium. It's the least dense planet in our solar system, so if you could find a bathtub big enough, it would float!", funfact: "Despite its large number of moons, none of Saturn's moons are as iconic as its rings.")
Card.create(object: saturn)

uranus = Planet.create(name_en: "uranus", name_fr: "uranus", star_id: sun.id, image_path: "uranus.png", classification: "gas giant", summary: "Uranus is a mysterious ice giant tipped on its side, giving it a unique appearance compared to the other planets. It's covered in thick clouds of methane, which give it a blue-green hue. Uranus is so far from the Sun that a year on Uranus lasts about 84 Earth years - talk about a long birthday wait!", funfact: "Uranus spins on its side, making its poles point towards and away from the Sun as it orbits, giving it some very extreme seasons!")
Card.create(object: uranus)

neptune = Planet.create(name_en: "neptune" ,name_fr: "neptune", summary: "Neptune is the farthest planet from the Sun and is named after the Roman god of the sea. It's a chilly ice giant with winds that whip around the planet at speeds of over 1,000 miles per hour. Neptune's atmosphere is made up of hydrogen, helium, and methane, giving it a deep blue color.", funfact: "Neptune's Great Dark Spot, similar to Jupiter's Great Red Spot, is a giant storm in its atmosphere that can change in size and shape over time.")

# Satellites
moon = Satellite.create(name_en: "moon", name_fr: "lune", planet_id: earth.id, summary: "The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite, lighting up our night sky with its gentle glow. It's covered in craters and plains, evidence of its turbulent past. The Moon's gravitational pull causes tides on Earth and has inspired countless myths and legends throughout history.", funfact: "Despite being our closest neighbor in space, we only ever see one side of the Moon from Earth - it's like it's playing a game of cosmic hide-and-seek with us!")
